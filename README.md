# Automated Monthly Solar Energy Report Sender

This project helps send monthly solar energy reports to clients automatically. It gets daily data from the iSolarCloud API, creates a CSV file with all the information, and sends it to the client‚Äôs email. It‚Äôs built using AWS Lambda and Python, and everything runs by itself at the start of each month.

- Collects daily solar production data from iSolarCloud for the last 30 days
